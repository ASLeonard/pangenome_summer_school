# Pangenome Summer School 2024

Some partial slides and exercises for the [Livestock pangenomics: how to construct and exploit whole genome information](https://formazionecontinua.unicatt.it/formazione-livestock-pangenomics-how-to-construct-and-exploit-whole-genome-information-a124pc06345-01) summer school.

Organised at the Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Piacenza by [Paolo Ajmone Marsan](https://docenti.unicatt.it/ppd2/en/docenti/12543/paolo-ajmone-marsan) and [John Williams](https://docenti.unicatt.it/ppd2/en/docenti/81487/john-lewis-williams).
