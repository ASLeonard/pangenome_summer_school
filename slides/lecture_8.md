Identification of assembly errors, finding rogue sequences, quality
metrics, assessment of completeness of the pangenome

 - identify poorly constructed regions
 - edit GFA files to resolve pangenome errors

# Overview

something

 - A
 - B

 Trimming out low quality nodes etc (vg clip, odgi depth?)

---

# Pangenome quality checking

Quality check, error identification and correction of pangenomes



---

# Pangenome correction

"Bad idea", but we can manually edit graßphs
(some semblance to Hi-C scaffolding)

---

# Bonus topics

Where should these go?
 - `vg surject`
 - personalised pangenomes
 -  "pangenome communities"

# Summary

TODO: add summary

# Questions?

And then lunch
