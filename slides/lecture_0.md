# What is a "genome"?

Something obvious

What ~is "my genome"~ are my genomes


---

# What is a "pangenome"?

First used in connection to bacteria -- many E. coli genomes share ~50% of genes, so the "set" of genes was the "pangenome".

Now we refer to a collection of *many* genomes as a pangenome.

In reality there are many types of pangenomes.
We will only discuss one flavour.

# So why just now?

Pangenomes may seem very obvious, but

 - Assemblies *were* extremely expensive/hard to produce
 - The scale of diversity (in humans at least) was underestimated
 - Alignment/graph algorithms weren't possible

---

# Some guiding steps

The goals of this course are to
 - perform analyses with long read data
 - construct and assess pangenomes
 - use pangenomes to find meaningful variation
